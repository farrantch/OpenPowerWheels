# OpenPowerWheels

OpenPowerWheels is an open-source project to control children's powerwheel toys using an ESP32 development board. This project aims to provide a customizable and easy-to-build solution for motor control. Previously, this project used an Arduino dev board, but I switched it to the ESP32 dev board due to lower cost and additional features.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 development board
- Motor driver compatible with the powerwheel's motor
- Battery suitable for the motor
- Wiring and connectors
- Powerwheel toy

## Installation
1. Assemble the hardware according to the schematics.
2. Connect the ESP32 to your computer.
3. Open the `OpenPowerWheels.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
4. Upload the code to the ESP32.

## Usage
Turn on the power to the ESP32 and motor driver. The powerwheel is now ready to be driven using the programmed controls.
